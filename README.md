# E2EE
Working example of end to end encryption

Notice: This file is not completed.

Overview, This file contains several headers that should work as separate entities; a DummyServer and LocalPrograms (representing the two clients). Comments are liberally used to help better understand how End to end encryption works.

Prerequisites, Understanding of object oriented programming, header files, constructors, and basic algebra

Note, as this project progresses, we will make member variables and functions private to try and accurately emulate End to End Encryption.

Main cpp is titled E2EE.cpp
